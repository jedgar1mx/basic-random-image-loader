# Basic Random Image Loader
Just a simple way to load random images dynamically.

# Instructions
To add and change the images just add/remove images from the "img" folder and add/remove the image set from the logos.json.

# Update
Number of images is determined by the size of "logos-container" and size of image and padding.
There are two variables in main.js
* padding & imageSize that you need to change according to your images.
Hope that helps.
